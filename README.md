# PaleoclimateModeling

This is a collection of Python Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating a few cases of analyses and visualization of (paleo-)climate model data. 
The data were produced with simulations with the coupled Earth System Models CLIMBER-X (Willeit et al. 2022) and Climber-3a (Morales-Maqueda et al. 2005) and were partially published by Landwehrs et al. (2020,2021,2022).

The repository contains all data to run the notebooks in a Python 3 environment if the required packages are installed, including numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, xarray etc.
