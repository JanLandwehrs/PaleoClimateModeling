# PaleoclimateModeling

This is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating a few cases of (paleo-)climate model data analyses and visualization. 
The climate simulations were carried out with the coupled Earth System Models CLIMBER-X ([Willeit et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-5905-2022)) and Climber-3Î± ([Montoya et al. 2005](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-005-0044-1)) and have been partially described and analyzed by Landwehrs et al. ([2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2020.116174), [2021](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020PA004134), 2022).

The repository contains all data to run the notebooks in a Python 3 environment if the required packages are installed. The latter include numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, xarray etc.

This material is based on the PhD project of [Jan Landwehrs](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6142-2237) at the University of Vienna, Department of Geology and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). The [High-Performance Computer](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/institute/about/it-services/hpc) (HPC) system of PIK was used to run the Earth System Models. Colleagues who contributed to this include Dr. habil. [Georg Feulner](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/members/feulner), Prof. [Michael Wagreich](https://geologie.univie.ac.at/wiss-mitarbeiter/michael-wagreich/), [Dr. Stefan Petri](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/members/petri) and Dr. [Matteo Willeit](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/members/willeit).
